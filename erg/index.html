                        <summary> NISSAN Skyline GT-R (R32) 1989 - 1994 </summary>
                        <p> The Nissan Skyline R32 was part of a long-range of performance vehicles made in Japan. The GT-R was introduced in 1989 after a long break.

                        In 1973, Nissan axed the Skyline GT-R performance model from its lineup. The times of oil crisis were on and the car manufacturers had to focus more on economy cars and the GT-R was not even close. But the Japanese car-manufacturer revived the GT-R name in 1989. It was designed to dominate the Group A class racing. But, to put the car on the starting grid, it had to build the series model.
                        
                        The bodywork was a sleek, two-door coupe. To fully comply with the regulations, the car had to be fitted with wider tires. That was why the fenders were enlarged, giving the car a more aggressive stance. A short trunk lid and a spoiler on it completed the car's silhouette. For the headlights, Nissan chose to go wit square looking elements, that were easier to repair if any damage occurred on the racetrack. The rear taillights were rounded and carried over from the regular, 4-door Skyline.
                        
                        Inside, the car featured four seats but only for insurance purposes. The rear legroom was not so important, especially for the race version that was fitted with only the driver's seat. A simple dash design with straight-forward lines and a 6-dials instrument cluster was adopted. A particular gauge was on the top right side of the instrument cluster showed the torque sent to the front wheels.
                        
                        The engine was an inline-six unit with a 2.6-liter displacement and twin-turbo. The all-wheel-drive system was new and it was specially developed for racing.

                        <summary> NISSAN Skyline GT-R (R33) 1995 - 1998 </summary>
                        <p> The fourth generation of the GT-R appeared in 1995, and even though it wasn't a major upgrade compared to its predecessor, it represented an essential step toward the GT-R R34.

                            Part of the Skyline family, the GT-R R33 was the wild child. For starters, it was a coupe and got all the good things from its predecessor, the R32 Skyline GT-R. Yet, it was less brutal, and somehow it was tamed. It tried to be both a decent personal coupe and a sports car.
                            
                            In the bio-design trend, the exterior received organic lines with shaved corners, soft curves, and not a single wedged shape. Moreover, even the front bumper that featured a broad center grille in the apron didn't look too aggressive. Yet, one of the most essential statements made by the carmaker was replacing the Nissan logo from the main grille with a GT-R badge. The profile revealed a simple, clean design of a coupe with a decently sized window behind the doors and a raked-forward C-pillar. Out back, the GT-R got a big wing on the trunk's lid. In the back, the quad, round taillights were already emblematic.
                            
                            Inside, the automaker kept almost the same interior as in a regular Skyline sedan or wagon, although it made a few modifications. For instance, the sports seats were high-bolstered. On the center stack, Nissan placed three additional gauges for front torque distribution, turbo pressure, and oil temperature. Moreover, besides the regular information, the GT-R got an oil-pressure gauge in the instrument cluster. Still, the standard steering wheel looked like it was carried over from a Maxima. The GT-R also offered a pair of seats in the back, and these were also bolstered on the sides, which was unusual.
                            
                            Under the hood, it was still the same RB26 engine that sent the power in all corners via a five-speed manual. Likewise, it was the same drivetrain used by the GT-R R32.

                        <summary> NISSAN Skyline GT-R (R34) 1999 - 2002 </summary>
                        <p> The legendary Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 has a cult following worldwide. It celebrates 40 years of automotive development and is still popular 30 years after manufacturing.

                            Ten years before Nissan released the R34, the R32 GT-R was rightfully called Godzilla. Japanese sports cars were entering a golden period, and GT-Rs could outperform most European and American models. The R34 GT-R had a shorter manufacturing window than the R32 and R33. That also reduces their numbers. Nissan sold approximately 64,000 Skylines between 1998 and 2001, but few were Godzilla-worthy.
                            
                            Musashimurayama produced 11,578 GT-Rs from 1999 to 2002. Nineteen of those automobiles would return to Nissan for an update, but more on that later. Over a dozen R34 GT-R versions exist, including Series 1, Series 2, V-Spec, and M-Spec. Some were harsh, with weight reduction enhancements and more, and manufacturing quantities varied. Finding a V-Spec II is difficult, since 1,855 were made.
                            
                            However, procuring a V-Spec II N1 is 100 times harder. Nissan produced two versions to commemorate the car's Nurburgring testing. For sprint and endurance racing, Japanese manufacturer Codename V-Spec II Nur and M-Spec Nur manufactured these cars.
                            
                            The R35 GT-R eliminated six-speed manual gearboxes, which were standard on all R34 GT-Rs. BNR34 had AWD and a sophisticated system, unlike entry-level Skylines. Even an ordinary driver may feel like a pro with the ATTESA ET-S Pro's torque-splitting capabilities. With AWD, the R34 GT-R weighed over 3,400 lbs (1,542 kg), more than a Mazda RX-7.
                            
                            That additional weight was unnecessary because of the RB26DETT. Nissan employed its 2.6-liter, twin-turbocharged, inline-six powertrain for nearly a decade before the R34. Over time, tweaks and enhancements made each generation stronger.
                            
                            In an era when most boosted automobiles had turbo-lag, the final "Godzilla" of the 20th century had enhanced ball-bearing turbos that gave it great throttle responsiveness. With the Japanese Gentlemen Agreement, the GT-R could produce 276 horsepower. However, multiple independent tests have shown north than 320 horsepower. The RB26DETT has great tuning possibilities with forged pistons and a cast iron block.
                            
                            Reports say you may safely increase to 500 or 600 horsepower without engine failure. Some R34 GT-R owners have reported $20,000 improvements to exceed 1,000 horsepower. Most Godzilla fans say the Omori plant produced the best model approximately 20 years ago.
                            
                            Nineteen automobiles received improvements that increased horsepower and torque to 493 and 398 lb-ft (540 Nm). Nissan used GT500 and LeMans GT2 technology to create the Nismo Z-Tune, one of the best GT-Rs ever. The RB26DETT became an RB28 with enhanced turbos and could accelerate the Z-Tune to 62 mph (100 kph) in 3.8 seconds.
                            
                            Knowing it may reach 203 mph (327 kph) thrilled Wangan worshipers even more. In 2003, a 911 Turbo S reached 197 mph. The Z-Tune costs seven figures, like most 20-year-old supercars, so few people would drive or own one. Prices for a normal R34 GT-R have been rising for years, with little indication of slowing.
                            
                            According to unconfirmed reports, Kazuo Shimizu drove the R34 GT-R around the Nurburgring Nordschleife in 7:52. If you can lap the North Loop in under eight minutes today, you're a fast driver. That outcome over 20 years ago must have been amazing.
                            
                            Consider that a Ferrari 360 Modena lapped in eight minutes and nine seconds that year. A Porsche 911 Turbo was four seconds slower than the R34 GT-R a year later. A notable journalist drove a BMW M4 on the Nordchsleife in 2014, coincidentally with Nissan's inception 15 years earlier. The R34 GT-R has additional racing accomplishments. In 2003, Masashi Motoyama won the All Japan Touring Car Championship in the GT500 class.

                        <summary> NISSAN GT-R (R35) 2007 - 2011 </summary>
                        <p> The GT-R badge was used for the first time in 1969 when Nissan released the 2.0-liter Nissan Skyline.

                            The Nissan GT-R R35 was presented at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2007 and entered the European market one year later.
                            
                            The all new GT-R's engine was hand-built by only 4 mechanics that were specially trained to do this.
                            
                            The engines were a 6-cylinder twin turbo V6 with 480 hp that rocketed the GT-R to 100 kph in just 3.6 seconds. And guess what, it only took 37 meters for the car to come to a full stop. The car had a top speed of 193 mph.
                            
                            The supercar had a dual-clutch transmission that was based on the Formula 1 technology. The GT-R was offered with an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive.
                            
                            With all its characteristics pointing to a track car, Nissan let the buyers know that the GT-R is suitable for different types of roads and could be driven by anyone due to its automatic transmission, and moreover, it had no problem being in the traffic. It had a reduced fuel consumption if the Race mode was not activated.
                            
                            The exterior design indicated a heavy, muscular car - which was true - but was designed with an extreme attention to every line, and even the side mirrors were built to channel the air to the rear spoiler.
                            
                            A supercar is expected to perform impeccably while high-speed-cornering, but the GT-R was extremely fast in straight lines as well.
